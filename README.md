## :interrobang: What is NGXF?
NGXF is a non-state management pattern + library for Angular. It acts as a multiple source of
truth for your application's state, providing simple rules for predictable state mutations.

NGXF is modeled after the CQRS pattern popularly implemented in libraries like Redux, NGRX and NGXS
but reduces boilerplate by using modern HTML features such as templates and directives.

If you're just getting started with NGXF, I recommend you head over to the [concepts](concepts/intro.md)
